The objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of 
a Sports Store's sales data to understand the perfomance of different products. By evaluating 
sales data the store can identify the top brands that drive customer loyalty
and generate  the highest sales. This analysis will provide insights into customer preferences 
and enable the store to make informed decisions about product assortment, brand partnerships, and
marketing campaigns.
